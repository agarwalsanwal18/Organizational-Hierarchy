# Organizational-Hierarchy

Designed an Organizational Hierarchy that worked as an employee chart, labelling each employee as per its level and id. The employee chart would adjust itself on addition of a new employee or even in the case an employee is fired. Implemented Binary Trees, Linked lists, Arrays, and Vectors for efficient storage and operations.
